# HTML Style Guide

## Context

This project (matrix-config) is a JavaScript library and does not include HTML markup.

This file is maintained for consistency with Agent OS standards but is not applicable to the current project.

The project does include test HTML files (`test-script-loading.html`, `test-script-unpkg.html`) which are used for testing the library integration. These should follow basic HTML standards:

- Use proper indentation (2 spaces)
- Include proper `<script>` tag placement
- Use semantic HTML structure for testing scenarios

If additional HTML is added to this project in the future, refer to the global Agent OS HTML standards or implement project-specific HTML guidelines here.
