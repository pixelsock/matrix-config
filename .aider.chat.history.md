#### take a look at build.js let's create another branch for these changes  

Sure, I can guide you through the process of creating a new branch for these changes. However, as you mentioned, the file `builder.js` is read-only. Could you please make it read-write so we can proceed with the changes?

#### /drop builder.js  
> Removed builder.js from the chat  

#### take a look at build.js and let's make another branch to work with  

Sure, to create a new branch for changes in `builder.js`, you need to use Git. Here are the steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Navigate to the directory where your project is located.
3. Check out a new branch using the command `git checkout -b <branch-name>`. Replace `<branch-name>` with the name you want for your new branch.

Please note that these instructions assume you have Git installed and your project is a Git repository. If that's not the case, please let me know so I can provide appropriate instructions.
